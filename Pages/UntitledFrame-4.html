This critical   engagement presupposes sustained evaluation of principles, traditions,   and requirements of building in all its aspects, interior and exterior.   Our goal is to advance the professions of architecture and interior   design by combining ethical judgment and technical proficiency in   pursuit of excellence, whether the product of our expertise is a   physical or intellectual construction.</p>
              <p>In view of constantly   changing conditions for practice, our program seeks to multiply insights   and abilities in every student - sensitivity to the aesthetic and   social responsibilities of environmental intervention; the life-long   cultivation of a broad, synthesizing, and humanistic world view; respect   for the benefits of research and innovation; deepened commitment to   specific lines of inquiry; an advanced understanding of the culture of   practice; readiness for professional responsibilities; design acumen,   advanced graphic skills and technical vocabulary; affection for risk;   and love of play.<br />
              </p>
            <p>Undergraduate degrees are offered in Architecture and Interior Design.   Master of Architecture and Master of Science in Architecture degrees are offered at the graduate level.</p></td>
