    <td width="972"><p>The Master of Science   in Architecture is a post-professional degree, usually best suited to   those who have completed a professional bachelor's degree, or those who   have strong backgrounds in other fields and whose interest in   architecture is of a theoretical or investigative nature. The program's   broadly intellectual emphasis enables in-depth critical involvement and   methodological acuity. The small program, with fewer than 20 students,   enjoys the advantages of low student-faculty ratios and informality with   most courses following the seminar format.</p>
