    <td width="947"><h3>About the Program</h3>
      <p>The Master of Architecture program at the University of Cincinnati   has two curricular tracks: one is for students with bachelor's degrees   in other fields (M Arch 1); the other supports those who currently hold   undergraduate degrees in architecture (M Arch 2).</p>
      <p>Four things distinguish the Cincinnati M Arch from those at most   other schools: our long tradition of co-operative professional education   (co-op), our open curriculum encouraging an individual choice of   research focus, our location in a top-tier interdisciplinary design/arts   college in a leading design city, and our consistently strong Design   Intelligence program rankings. Read more about these features below.</p>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>The study of architecture at the master's level requires a commitment   to the design and production of buildings that are useful, durable,   meaningful, inspiring, and responsibly engaged with their physical,   cultural, and social contexts. Architecture is a useful art, a technical   craft, and an ethical practice. Cincinnati's professional,   design-centered approach encompasses this range of issues, preparing   graduates for licensing and a critical engagement with the world of   practice. This critical spirit does not simply accept presumptions and   practices at face value, but examines their provenance and consequences   with a wary eye and an open mind. The program seeks to promote   leadership, collaboration, intellectual depth, flexibility, innovation,   and teamwork - elevating professional esteem and multiplying career   opportunities for our graduates. The discipline of architecture is   continually changing. Graduates encounter an information-intensive   professional world, full of situations demanding critical and   imaginative thinking. The Master of Architecture program engages   fundamental knowledge and skills, and emphasizes comprehensive design,   while affording students the opportunity to expand horizons through   flexibility, experimentation, and risk-taking. The program provides   substantial opportunities for guided investigations of individual   architectural interests, building intellectual rigor as well as skill   development through a collegial atmosphere emphasizing mentoring,   coaching, and advising.</p>
      <p><strong>The Co-op Program: </strong> Cooperative   education is a century-long tradition at the University of Cincinnati,   and is the envy of the field. Within the curriculum, students cross back   and forth between the academic and commercial worlds of architecture,   strengthening their understanding of the integration of theory and   practice, discipline and profession. At the graduate level, the co-op   experience includes specific learning experiences that operate between   these two traditional sites of instruction, linking our 700-firm   employer network into academic course work and research objectives   through a guided, 26-week graduate co-op experience related to each   student's thesis topic.</p>
      <p><strong>Research Concentrations:</strong>  Your   individual choice of research focus will dominate the latter part of   the curriculum. Courses provide mentorship and guidance in developing an   area of focus to inform and accompany your final thesis project,   working with faculty members one-on-one and in small groups. Graduate   elective studios involve independent, student-led research in support of   design work; you'll learn to articulate clearly your theoretical   position, methodology, and design intentions. With faculty advisers,   you'll define an area of academic concentration, and tailor your   research efforts, co-op experiences, and elective choices to inform the   extensive written and design components of your final-year thesis   investigation.</p>
      <p><strong>The Cincinnati Context</strong>:  We're   situated in a leading design college, in a distinguished research   university, in a vibrant design city. Cincinnati's internationally   acclaimed College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning (DAAP)   supports a multidisciplinary design and art culture that comes alive   within our Eisenman-designed building. The proximity of programs in   interior design, graphic design, digital design, industrial design,   fashion design, art history, art education, fine arts, urban planning,   and urban studies, offers you many opportunities to take elective or   collaborative course work in these fields and to develop areas of   expertise that leverage partnerships among diverse faculty and students.   The city of Cincinnati offers a pleasant physical and cultural   environment, and is home to many internationally-known design firms and   Fortune 500 companies. It has world-class performing and visual arts,   distinguished urban neighborhoods and rich traditions, and one of the   largest concentrations of world-renowned contemporary architecture in   the world.</p>
      <p><strong>The Rankings: </strong> Our   consistently high Design Intelligence rankings reflect our   long-standing tradition and durable reputation for producing the   nation's most practice-ready architectural graduates. Unlike other   national program rankings, Design Intelligence polls the employers of   recent graduates, so their results directly reflect the quality of our   students' professional preparation. DAAP's long-time commitment to   high-quality professional education (and the huge number of our alumni   and co-op employers who are now leaders in the design fields), will   ensure that the top-tier reputation of your Cincinnati degree will be   sustained throughout your career.</p>
      <p><strong>A Career in Architecture:</strong>  Most   architectural graduates work in architectural firms, which often employ   other design professionals as well. While the great majority of   architectural offices have fewer than 10 employees, who typically assume   a wide range of responsibilities, architects in large firms may focus   on more specialized roles such as design, technical support, business   management and marketing, facility programming, or historic   preservation. An architectural degree can also lead to a career in   interior design, urban design and planning, engineering, construction,   real estate development, or university teaching. In recent years, the   field of architecture has been in the midst of several important   transformations around issues such as environmental sustainability, new   building and modeling technologies, new design vocabularies, and new   approaches to urbanism and the city.</p>
      <p><strong>Curriculum Tracks</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Two Curricular Tracks: </strong> Students   enter one of two curricula based on their prior academic and   professional experience. These are diagrammed on the next page. The M   Arch 1 is for students with an undergraduate degree in a discipline   other than architecture, and the M Arch 2 is for students with a prior   degree in architecture. For more information on the components of each   of these curricula, such as option quarter, research and thesis years,   elective guidelines, etc., please refer to the &quot;Frequently Asked   Questions&quot; below.</p>
      <p><strong>Our M Arch 1 Curriculum: </strong> Students   coming from another discipline begin with an intensive accelerated   foundation in professional skills and knowledge, coupled with a broadly   interdisciplinary introduction to architecture and its role in the   world. There are eleven academic quarters, four co-op work quarters, and   an Option Quarter; requiring 181 total quarter credit hours including   advanced standing credits. The M Arch 1 curriculum begins in the summer   quarter (mid-June). The above chart gives an overview of the curriculum,   and the sequence of courses and co-op quarters.</p>
      <p><strong>Our M Arch 2 Curriculum:</strong>  This   shorter track is for students with a B.S. in Architecture or an   equivalent degree that partially fulfills NAAB (National Architectural   Accreditation Board) requirements, and who may have less than a year of   architecture-related work experience. This curriculum includes seven   academic quarters and four quarters of co-op work experience. (Qualified   candidates from the University of Cincinnati's closely-articulated BS   Arch program are placed in the M Arch 2 with advanced standing, and   receive an Option Quarter of study.) Degree quarter credit hour   requirements range from 79-112. The M Arch 2 curriculum begins in the   fall quarter (mid-September). For an overview of the curriculum,   sequence of courses and co-op quarters, please refer to the chart above. </p>
