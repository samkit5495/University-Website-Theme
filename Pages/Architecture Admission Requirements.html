        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The academic credentials of last year's accepted students</li>
          <li>Application components, priority deadline, and high school course requirements for high school students</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Academic Credentials</h4>
        <p>The academic credentials of the pool of applicants seeking admission   to the School of Architecture and Interior Design vary each year. This   program is highly competitive and has a limited number of spaces   available.</p>
        <p>The freshman class profile for Architecture is based on the middle 50% of the 2010 entering freshman class:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GPA: 3.680 - 4.000</li>
          <li>ACT: 28 - 32</li>
          <li>SAT: 1250 – 1370</li>
          <li>Average Class Rank: Top 13.2%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We share these numbers to give you an idea of the &quot;typical&quot;   credentials of students accepted into our programs. Scoring within this   range (or outside of it) is not a guarantee of admission or denial.</p>
        <p>The transfer students accepted to the program typically have a   cumulative college GPA that is well above the 3.25 minimum GPA   requirement.</p>
